# 🌿 Plant Leaf Disease Detection using YOLOv8

This project is focused on building an efficient and accurate plant leaf disease detection system using **YOLOv8**, a cutting-edge real-time object detection model. Early detection of plant diseases can help farmers and agricultural professionals take timely action, reducing crop loss and improving yield quality.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time detection of diseases in plant leaves using YOLOv8
- 🖼️ Image upload via a modern web interface
- 📊 Disease detection results and image metadata stored in MongoDB
- 🌐 Full-stack application with React frontend, Flask backend, and MongoDB database

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- **Backend:** [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- **Database:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- **Model:** [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)

## 📷 How It Works

1. User either uploads an image or captures one using the camera through the React interface.
2. The image is sent to the Flask backend.
3. YOLOv8 processes the image and detects any signs of disease.
4. Results are stored in MongoDB and displayed on the frontend.
